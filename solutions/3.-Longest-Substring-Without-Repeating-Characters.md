# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example 1
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

### Example 2
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

### Example 3
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

### Example 4
Input: s = ""
Output: 0

# Solutions

## brute force
Time: O(n^3)
Space: O(n)

Basically iterate all substrings O(n^2), and check if no duplicate chars in it O(n)

## two pointer
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

Idea is to maintain a sliding window which has no duplicate chars. Suppose left pointer is at `x`, we Keep expanding the right boundary to find the max possible substring until we hit a repeat char, so this is the max substring from index `x`. Then we move left pointer to the right , until there is no repeat (suppose moved `a` positions), now the window is valid again. We can then repeat the above process to find max substring from index `x + a`, ...

```py
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
  n = len(s)
  l = 0
  r = 0
  curMax = 0
  curChars = set()
  
  while ((r < n) and (l < n - curMax)):
    c = s[r]
    if c not in curChars:
      # expand right boundary
      curChars.add(c)
      r += 1
    else:
      # remove from the left
      curMax = max(curMax, r - l)   # not r - l + 1 since length not includes r
      curChars.remove(s[l])
      l += 1
  
  curMax = max(curMax, r - l)

  return curMax
```

Another way to further make it faster is, instead of saving the chars, we also save their positions using a map, so we can jump to the index directly. Note that we don't clean previously saved chars, so when `c in cToi`, we don't know if `c` is in current substring, or is it in previous string. So instead of `l = cToi[c] + 1`, we need to do `l = max(l, cToi[c] + 1)` to make sure only jump forward (only jump when `c` is in current substring).
```py
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
  n = len(s)
  l = 0
  curMax = 0
  cToi = {}
  
  for r in range(n):
    c = s[r]
    if c in cToi:
      # make sure don't jump back
      l = max(l, cToi[c] + 1)
    
    curMax = max(curMax, r - l + 1)
    cToi[c] = r

  return curMax
```
